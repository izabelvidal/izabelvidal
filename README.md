My name is Felipe Fialho from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been trying to be a web developer since 2017, since then i also have been trying to get a degree in computer science 💻. I'm passionate with web development since 2015. I'm a person that don't quit easely. My goal is get to know and work around the whole world 🌎. New Zealand 🇳🇿  is the first country that I've ever met.

I speake four languages:
Portuguese -> 🇧🇷
English -> 🇬🇧
Swedish -> 🇸🇪
German -> 🇩🇪

In my free time i like to study new languages 📜, wacth movies and tv series 🎞️, play with my cats 🐱, try to learn how to play guitar 🎸, and the most important, besides sleeping 💤, listing to musica and dancing 🎶. Some of friends would say i'm a great cooker, they're totally right!!!
